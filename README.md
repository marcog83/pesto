# 🍃 Pesto
Pesto, pronounced like [ˈpɛ.sto], is collection of small, flavorful utilities for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

Each package is independent, like ingredients — mix only what you need.
## Philosophy

Pesto is about:

* **Small portions** → each package solves one problem.

* **Composable recipes** → utilities can be combined freely.

* **Simple ingredients** → minimal dependencies, clear APIs.
