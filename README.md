# 🫓 Piadina
flatbread from Romagna, Italian street food classic, pronounced [pjaˈdiːna] — like *pya-DEE-nah*. It is collection of small, flavorful utilities for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

It’s a base (you can fill it with anything) → exactly like each package. — mix only what you need.

## Philosophy

Piadina is about:

* **Small portions** → each package solves one problem.

* **Composable recipes** → utilities can be combined freely.

* **Simple ingredients** → minimal dependencies, clear APIs.
